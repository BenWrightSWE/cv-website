                <p class="tag-line-p">I am interested in anything from front end code to machine learning. I believe a job entailing
                working on Web Apps that help other people within the company would be ideal for me. Otherwise,
                I'd love to be working towards helping others with whatever code I am working on. Perferably I'd
                love to be working on a job using HTML, SCSS, Typescript, and React for the front end
                and then Java mainly for the back end.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Languages: HTML, CSS,  JavaScript</li>
                        <li>Rooted is a site with a meditaion timer. You can choose the time and press play/stop. Then each of the
                            leaves can change the time. As the time progresses the leaves change based on a prechosen set of sub
                            times. When the timer is done there is an alert and sound. At the bottom the page it has a dropdown
                            style article that allows the user to understand how and why they should meditate and also some good
                            meditiation resources.</li>
                        <li>Main Challenges: When I stopped the timer and tried restarting it, it created a new timer and they would
                            consistently switch being the timers set. When I was trying to change the color of the "leaves" of the
                            tree, after the initial change, it wouldn't allow the hover change to occur. When trying to make a
                            condition for a symbol, the javascript version of the symbol and the symbol gotten from the input wasn't
                            the same text wise even when they were symbol wise. (fixed with the conditionSymbol id in the HTML which
                            is called when it's needed in the Javascript)</li>

                        <li>It allows you to put in your choice of meal, cuisine, and type and be able to get a list of random
                            recipes to choose from. When you choose your recipe, it presents a small general information tab,
                            then presents a list of the ingredients and some nutrition facts of the ingredients.</li>
                        <li>Limits: since this is dealing with an API the limits on the API are dealt with limiting the amount
                            of ingredients per choice of recipe. Each hour you can get about 100 calls or 100 recipe choices.</li>

                        <li>The CRM webapp allows the freelancer to track how each lead is in their business
                            process. It takes in the information from the website's form or allows the freelancer to create a new
                            client themselves. Then from there they can update where they are in their process as it goes along. </li>
                        <li>The CRM also includes a schedule calendar so that the user can track their meeting times.</li>
